# HashCracker
## JavaFX Encryption Engine and Cracker

This project was originally created in 2022. It runs off of JavaFX and a few other dependencies which are currently out of date this many years later.
As a converted C developer, I don't have too much interest in continuing this project in Java, but am working to at the very minimum ensure it builds,
as well as code each of the encryption algorithms myself to better understand ones such as AES and SHA.

In the near future, I plan on having a built version available, as I understand the perils of downloading and building it yourself.

> The dependencies for this project are out of date. They will be updated in the near future.
